# StaySafeBKLP
*Note: Upon testing by installing the app on an iPhone, creating a new trip works without issues. However, when using XCode's simulator, an internal error happens. We tested the application on iPhones directly and considered that an end-user would not be impacted by the issue. If you cannot create a trip using the simulator, please try doing so by installing the app!*
